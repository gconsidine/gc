                | This animation was made over the course of a day or two as a class project.  It was one
                | of my first attempts at working with HTML5 canvas, and my first attempt at a
                | side-scrolling animation.  Projects were due on a weekly basis in this particular
                | class, so I was never able to squeeze as much detail as I wanted into anything I
                | created.  This animation features a little truck putt-putting along, and was inspired
                | by a road trip I took up the 5 Freeway a few years ago.

                | I took a different approach to 
                em Forest Moon
                |  from my other animations, but I
                |             was still bound by the same time constraints in the course so I wasn&apos;t able to add in
                |             the detail I originally planned. I layered three canvas elements: one layer for the
                |             orbiting sun and moon (the moon also transitions through its phases every 28 periods),
                |             one layer for the randomly placed (within particular parameters) terrestrial elements,
                |             and one layer for actors -- though the only actor ended up being a triangular
                |             UFO-thing.

                em Squares and Triangles
                |  was quickly made, and although I wasn&apos;t really
                |             satisfied with the general idea for this animation, I do like the artifacts that
                |             appear as the shapes are drawn, and as they&apos;re incompletely erased when the animation
                |             winds back around.

                | GitHub has become an indispensable tool, community, and resource for me. Lately, I&apos;ve
                | been taking cues from the many great projects I&apos;ve had the pleasure of using.  While I
                | don&apos;t open source all of my projects (client projects in particular), I do try to keep
                | everything else open on the MIT license -- even the old projects that make me cringe a
                | bit when I revisit them.

                | Testing has moved to the forefront of my thought process while writing code nowadays.
                | Now that I&apos;ve invested the time to integrate automated testing into my workflow, it&apos;s
                | hard to imagine living without it.  It provides a level of confidence, security, and
                | assurance that just isn&apos;t attainable otherwise.

                | Coveralls is a great open source tool to provide coverage statistics on your open

                | Over time, I&apos;ve worked to refine and automate my workflow.  Using Travis CI on open
                | source projects has been a big help in automating full builds and relaying the status
                | back to GitHub.  Travis CI becomes more useful as you introduce more automation
                | into your workflow: server-side dependencies fetched via npm, client-side dependencies
                | fetched via Bower, linting, concatenation, minification, testing, etc.
